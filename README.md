# My Neovim Config

The language servers that are used are currently packaged in a home manager
module. This should probably change. To try it out simply run

```
nix run github:kentookura/neovim
```

This whole config is so big at this point that it is not very uniform. There are
a lot of places that could really benefit from a closer look.
